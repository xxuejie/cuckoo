A pretty dumb Twitter clone

This is a toy project for playing with AngularJS. Twitter bootstrap will be used for client-side design(I suck at CSS-_-), Sinatra will be used for backend APIs. Most of the application logic will be on the front end Angular side.

NOTE: Maybe [cuba](http://cuba.is/) is worth a try, but introducing new stuffs at both the frontend and backend maybe too much work. I think I will give cuba a chance next time:)
